## App downloads: Number per day, during a **single week**

what type of plot would you choose to visualize the data below?

```{r}

n_dl |> 
  knitr::kable(format = 'html') |> 
  kableExtra::column_spec(seq_along(n_dl), width = '50px')

```

## What plot?

::: panel-tabset
### Bar

![](../images/what-plot_ndl_bar.png)

-   Bar plot
    -   good for counts
    -   good for discrete point values
    -   but why not just use a point?

### Point

![](../images/what-plot_ndl_point.png)

-   Point plot
    -   Conveys *exactly* the same information as the bar plot
    -   However, points might look a bit disconnected
    -   Using points also reduces the need to include 0 on the y axis because there is no longer any possibility of comparing bar areas.

### Lollipop

![](../images/what-plot_ndl_lollipop.png)

-   Lollipop plot
    -   Conveys *exactly* the same information as the bar plot.
    -   helps reduce the "floatiness" of the points.
    -   Again 0 should be included.
    -   Works well with lots of points.

### Line

![](../images/what-plot_ndl_line.png)

-   Line plot
    -   Connecting points with a line suggests the points follow a sequence, e.g. day order.

### Pie

![](../images/what-plot_ndl_pie.png)

-   Pie chart
    -   Eww, yuck!
    -   Too many categories.
    -   Which is bigger: Tue, Wed, Thu, or Sun?
    -   We are pretty decent at noticing deviations from straight / level
        -   but pretty poor at putting a number on the deviation.

## Clients: Age data

Here we have many values for each of three categories.
The data show the ages of people downloading an app, from three different sectors.
Each category has a different number of observations.
Decide if we want to see every single observation or summarize in some way.

-   N observations
    -   Retail: 80\
    -   Construction: 50\
    -   Care: 30

```{r}

age_by_ind

```

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" collapse="true"}
## what plot?

::: panel-tabset
### Hist age

![](../images/what-plot_age-by-ind_density.png)

-   Density plot
    -   Good for visualizing distribution of continuous data
    -   Nice to overlap if only a few categories

### Dotplot

![](../images/what-plot_age-by-ind_dotplot.png)

### Violin plot

![](../images/what-plot_age-by-ind_beeswarm.png)

Violin plots convey more info than either bar plots or boxplots, especially if you show points.

This plot hints at a compelling story about how users from different industries use the app.

### Average summary bar chart

![](../images/what-plot_age-by-ind_plot_bar-avg.png)

-   Not a good choice for showing summaries
    -   Too much information lost

### Boxlot

![](../images/what-plot_age-by-ind_boxplot.png)

### Combo plot

![](../images/what-plot_age-by-ind_summary-combo.png)

## Churn: percent-per-year plots

```{r}

churn_data |> 
  rename('churn (%)' = churn) |>
  knitr::kable(format = 'html') |> 
  kableExtra::column_spec(2, width = '100px')

```

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" collapse="true"}
## What plot?

::: panel-tabset
### Bar plot

![](../images/what-plot_churn_bar.png)

### Stacked bars as percent

![](../images/what-plot_churn_bar-stacked.png)

### Pie

![](../images/what-plot_churn_pie.png)

## Clients: By industry

Using the same data as earlier, we want to get a better idea of the breakdown of industry types using our app.

Remember, in the full data there are:

-   N observations
    -   Retail: 80\
    -   Construction: 50\
    -   Care: 30

Here's a recap of how it looks

```{r}
age_by_ind |> 
  group_by(industry) |> 
  slice(1:3)
```

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" collapse="true"}
## What plot?

::: panel-tabset
### Bar plot - Count

![](../images/what-plot_age-by-ind_bar-count.png)

### Stacked count

![](../images/what-plot_age-by-ind_bar-stacked.png)

### Stacked percent

![](../images/what-plot_age-by-ind_bar-stacked-pc.png)

### Pie
