Formulate business relevant questions**\n\nWith your colleague(s) discuss what other information you would like to know before agreeing or disagreeing with The Boss.\n\nCreate a list of as many important questions you can think of, that you would like answered.\n:::\n\n## Part 1 --- How can we be sure?\n\nWe are going to explore how different possible answers to those questions might affect how we come to a decision.\n\n::: callout-caution\n### Assumptions for our scenario\n\nThe scenario is deliberately simple.\n\nThere is a historic average, which should consider as a baseline for our business, and should be taken at face value.\n\nThis baseline is based on the business' performance prior to the \"marketing campaign\".\nThe observed value should also be taken at face value as the performance after the marketing campaign.\nThe purpose of it is to provide a scaffold for discussions, not to get tied up with the real life business details about how flooglebinder sales might respond to external, or seasonal, or etc., factors.\n:::\n\n### Average expectation\n\n![Sample average (observed) vs expected average](../images/d2-s1_improved-sales.png){#fig-exp-vs-sample alt=\"Plot showing a horizontal line labelled \\\"Expected\\\" at y = £100, and an \\\"Observed\\\" value of £109.66 \" fig-align=\"left\" width=\"40%\"}\n\n@fig-exp-vs-sample above shows a horizontal gold line at £100.\nThis indicates the all-time historic average for our company.\nFor the purposes of this exercise, we shall consider this an unambiguous \"truth\" of what our business has made in an average week.\nIt is therefore not a **statistic**, since statistics are values that are used to **estimate** \"true\" parameters.\n\nLooking at this we see that the recent sample yielded an average value higher than the historic average.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n### **2. Questions**\n\n1.  How much would you trust that this increased value is likely to continue in future weeks?\n2.  What factors can you identify that might support your answer for question 1?\n    i.  If you would be enthusiastic that this is a strong result to take to The Boss, create a list of reasons that justify your belief.\n    ii. If you are less than enthusiastic create a list of reasons, along with ideas that would increase your willingness to go to The Boss.\n    iii. If you are not sure, create both of the above lists!\n:::\n\nNow that you have created a list follow this [link](https://cc-stats.shinyapps.io/uncertainty).\nThe plot on the left is the same as that in @fig-exp-vs-sample, but with a different \"observed\" value.\nThe value you see will be unique to your team, and is the result that you will be considering.\nIf it is above expectation, The Boss will be happy, if not, they won't!\nFor our purposes, we will assume a change of at least **1 percent** to be an outcome that has real importance for our business.\nIt is your job to decide whether the marketing campaign was a success or a failure, and choose to either agree or disagree with The Boss.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n#### **3. Discuss**\n\nWhat are your impressions of this new value with regards to the marketing campaign, and The Boss' assumed reaction?\n:::\n\nNow create a table with a column called `n = 5` (we will add a few more columns as we go).\nYou can create your table on paper or using the desktop app of your choice.\nRecord your value in your table.\nPlease keep your notes close at hand for future reference.\n\nNow... unbeknownst to Boss we have somehow acquired superhero like powers that allow us to see how/whether sales continue to respond to our marketing campaign.\nWe have the ability to simulate what the observed value might be like in future weeks, by pressing the ![](../images/btn_new-sample){width=\"108\" alt=\"\\\"New sample\\\"\"} button.\nPress it several times, and, after each press, record the new observed value.\nYou should see that the observed value changes - possibly by quite a lot!\nNotice also that the two graphs on the right respond to any changes---more about these later.\n\nThere are several controls in the left sidebar that we can experiment with to help understand some of the factors that influence the value, and possibly indicate how much faith we should have in our results.\nThere are quite a few controls, so lets explore them one at a time.\n\n### Sample size {#sample-size}\n\n![](../images/input_n-sales-5.png){#fig-n-sales-input display=\"inline\" width=\"300\" alt=\"sample size input, set to n = 5\"}\n\nThe first control we will look at on the left is labelled \"Number of sales\".\nIt is currently set at `5`, and indicates that five sales were made during the week.\nYou have just seen how the observed value changes, sometimes quite dramatically, week to week.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n#### **4. Discuss**\n\nGiven that our information is based on five customers discuss why the fact that this is based on 5 sales causes the value to jump around so much?\n\n-   How likely is it that they represent our \"average customer\"?\n-   How confident would you feel making future decisions based on these five sales?\n-   What message might you have for The Boss?\n:::\n\nLet's have a look at the individual sales, tick the \"Show sales\" box.\n\n![](../images/input_cb-show-sales.png){width=\"300\" alt=\"two checkboxes labeled \\\"Margin of error\\\" and \\\"Sales\\\". The bottom box, \\\"Sales\\\" has been checked\"}\n\nThe small red points that appeared on the plot show the values of each of the sales made.\nIt might now be clearer that the large red point labelled \"Observed value\" actually represents the mean of all the sales.\nPress the ![](../images/btn_new-sample.png){width=\"108\" alt=\"\\\"New sample\\\"\"} button several more times.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n#### **5. Discuss**\n\nHow do you think increasing the number of sales will affect the observed value?\n\nHow do you think increasing the number of sales will affect your opinion of the marketing strategy?\n\nRemember, The Boss has no idea about any of these future outcomes.\n\nHow might you convey these insights to The Boss?\n:::\n\nIn your table, create a new column with the header `n = 20` .\nNow change the \"Number of sales\" input to 20, and try several new samples (press ![](../images/btn_new-sample.png){width=\"107\" alt=\"\\\"New sample\\\"\"}).\nRecord each of the new values in your table.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n#### **6. Discuss**\n\nCompare the values from each of the two columns of your table.\n\nDiscuss how the values are similar and how they are different.\n\nWhat does having more sales mean in terms of approaching The Boss with a decision?\n\nWhat if we had 100 sales?\nAdd one more column `n = 100` and compare those values.\n:::\n\nAt this point The Boss tracks you down, and wants confirmation that they were correct.\nWhat can you tell them?\n\n-   Has the marketing campaign affected the customer base?\n-   In what direction---are they spending more or less than before?\n-   If the previous average was £100, what is your best guess at the new average?\n-   Write down what you think the new average sale is.\n\n### Precision\n\nThe Boss was somewhat impressed by your investigative skills, and is almost content to take your word for it.\nHowever, they realize that the average sale will vary week to week.\nThey want you to give a best guess that somehow accounts for this variation.\n\nHopefully we were able to see, and articulate in our teams, how more sales affected our average sales value.\nHowever, just having more sales might not be enough to allow us to come to a decision.\nIf you carried out the last instruction in the box above, you should have number of sales set to 100.\nChange the input below that called \"Spread of values\", to 50, hit ![](../images/btn_new-sample.png){width=\"107\" alt=\"\\\"New sample\\\"\"} a few more times.\n\nHmm, things just got unpredictable again, right?\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n#### **7. Discuss**\n\nWhat might this \"Spread of values\" input represent in for our business---How about in a real-world/business context?\nCan you think of a parallel in your own line of work?\n\n::: {.callout collapse=\"true\"}\n##### Hint\n\nConsider the price range of the stock.\nHow similar are multiple sales likely to be?\n:::\n:::\n\nThe width of the range of values has an important effect on our average sale value.\nSuppose everything we sold cost £100.\nWith 5 sales, we could be 100% certain of what our average sales would be £100.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n#### **8. Discuss**\n\nConsider the following business:\n\n1.  Budget store -- prices range between £80 - £90\n2.  Generalist store -- prices range between £85 - £105\n3.  Specialist high-end store -- prices range between £105 - £110\n\nSuppose each business makes the same number of sales.\n\nHow would this range of stock prices affect the average sales values?\n\nWhich business should be able to make the most precise projections for the future?\n\nWhich would be least accurate?\n:::\n\nOk, time for a slight confession---I'm afraid the task above was a little bit of a mean trick!\nTo be fair, though, there was a clue in the section header.\nSee, given a large enough number of sales, all three businesses could create similarly **accurate** projections.\nThis is what the mean does.\nWhile the estimate may jump about wildly when the sample size (number of sales) is small, it tends to do so around the actual true mean.\nWhere the businesses would differ is in the **precision** of their projections.\nIn order to increase our precision we have to reduce the range within which the estimate jumps around.\n\nThe current input settings should be as show on the right, top.\nTo get a better understanding of how the \"spread\" relates to the precision, tick the \"Show margin of error\" box (right, bottom).\nThis will make a few changes.\nFirst you will notice there are now error bars extending form the red point on the plot.\nOne other thing that has changed is the box under the plot labelled \"Confidence interval\" now show the range of the margin of error (MoE).\n\n::: {layout=\"[[30, -5, 30], [30, -5, 30]]\" layout-valign=\"center\"}\n![](../images/input-n100-s50.png){width=\"250\" alt=\"Two numeric inputs for changing the number of sales (top - displaying 100) and the \\\"spread\\\" of the data (bottom - displaying 50).\"}\n\n![](../images/vb_ci-unknown.png){width=\"250\" alt=\"Value box, showing a confidence interval of unknown value.

The title bar of the box is green indicating that the margin of error does not cover the expected value of 100.\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n#### **9. Task**\n\nExperiment with the sample size and spread values to manipulate the margin of error.\n\nWhich combinations create a wide MoE, and which create a narrow MoE.\n\nRecord a few observations---they might come in handy later.\n\nAlso have a think about what those combinations might mean in a real-world context.\nFor example, consider the three business types above.\n\n::: {.callout icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n##### **Hint**\n\nIf the spread is small, how many sales do we need to have a small MoE?\n:::\n:::\n\nWe can now see that while the sample size can help us guess what the average is, how much future weeks deviate from our guess depends on the spread, or the **variation** in our sales values.\n\nThe next time The Boss comes calling we can now give an average and a likely upper and lower limit for our estimate.\n\"That's great,\" says Boss, \"But what do you mean by *likely* limits?\"\n\n### Margin of error {#margin-of-error}\n\nWhat we have been tip-toeing around is the concept of a **confidence interval** (CI).\nThe language for dealing with these is a bit statsy and confusing, so we'll try and set some expectations first which we will then try and test to confirm or refute.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n#### **10. Discuss**\n\nYou inform Boss that the margin of error you quoted is actually a 95% confidence interval.\n\"Very good,\" says Boss, \"Why only 95%? Why not 99%? Actually, do we even need to be 95% confident? Can't we settle for 90%?\"\n\nWell, these are all good questions.\n\nBefore you change the CI, discuss what will happen to the error bars when you change to 90% or 99%.\nMake a note of your expectations.\n\nWhat might the pros and cons be for each option?\nWhat advantages might a 90% CI have over a 99% CI and vice versa?\nMake a note of any ideas you have for these also.\n:::\n\nSo far we have been dealing with a 95%.\nGo ahead ahead now and change the selection.\n\n![](../images/input_rb-ci-95.png){width=\"250\" alt=\"Radio button allowing choices for the margin of error between 90%, 95% and 99%. Displays 95% as selected\"}\n\nWatch what happens to the error bars as you do this.\nCompare the changes to the notes you took in your previous discussion.\nWas your expectation correct?\nIf not try and explain why.\n\nNow here comes the hard stuff.\nIt is a very common misunderstanding that a 95% confidence interval means that there is a 95% chance that the true value is within the CI.\nSo lets break it down.\n\n1.  What do we mean by \"true value\"?\n    -   In our case, the true value is the **actual** average sale for our customer base\n    -   (More generally this would be the underlying population parameter.)\n2.  We don't know what the true value is, that is why we are need statistics.\n    -   But every week, our CI is slightly different, so that proves the misunderstanding is false.\n    -   For several different CIs to all have a 95% chance of containing the true value doesn't make sense\n3.  If we turn that idea upside down and instead say...\n    -   Of the CIs we compute for the next $X$ weeks, 95% of them will cover the true mean.\n\nHmmm, what does that actually mean?\nWell for one thing, it means even if we have everything in place exactly as we would like, we might still be wrong.\n\nThe more important question is how can we use this concept?\nRemember our question is to investigate whether our marketing campaign has caused a shift in our customer base.\nIf we can show, within some level of confidence, that our new customer base spends a different amount on average than our old customer base, then we can conclude that our marketing campaign did cause a shift.\n\nSo, based on our new sample we have an estimate of our customer's spends.\nAnd we have some margin of error around that mean.\nNow, here's the clever bit.\n\n::: columns\n::: column\n::: {#fig-ci-coverage layout-ncol=\"1\"}\n![CI covers expected value](../images/d2-s1_plot_ci-covers-expected.png){alt=\"Observed value is 90, but the upper limit of the margin of error extends to 105.\"}\n\n![CI does not cover expected value](../images/d2-s1_plot_ci-misses-expected.png){alt=\"Observed value is 93, and the upper limit of the margin of error stops at 98, below the expected value.\"}\n\nHave the week's sales actually been different from the expectation?\n:::\n:::\n\n::: column\n-   If that CI covers the expected average of the *old* customer base,\n    -   That means that the old average could be the true mean for the new base.\n    -   And, if that is true, we are forced to admit that there is no evidence that the customer base has been influenced by any meaningful amount.\n\n<br>\n\n-   Conversely, if the CI **does not** cover the old average...\n    -   It suggests that the new average is sufficiently far from the old average\n\n    -   And that the spread of the data is accounted for well enough that we have evidence that the new customers are indeed from a different group than the old customers.\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {#box-best-ci-disc .callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n#### **11. Discussion**\n\nSpend five minutes working through the details of this stuff.\nGiven that using a 90% CI makes it easier for the marketing department to claim success, why would anyone use any other CI threshold?\n\n::: {.callout collapse=\"true\"}\n##### **Hint**\n\nWhy not use an 80% CI?\nOr a 50% CI?\n:::\n:::\n\n### Summary\n\nSo far we have built our understanding that the average weekly sales value is centred around some value that is what our customer base spends on average per week.\nSometimes customers spend more than this central value, and sometimes they spend less.\nHowever, the final point to realise, is that no matter what each individual spends, the total weekly sales value will tend to cluster around the expected average for our business (@fig-summary-bell-curve).\n\n![Possible distibution of average weekly sales.](../images/d2-s1_plot_part-1-summary.png){#fig-summary-bell-curve width=\"40%\" fig-align=\"left\" alt=\"Bell shaped curve centred over 100\"}\n\nHow close they are to the average depends on the number of sales made (the sample size) and the variance (or spread) of sales values.\nThe further away from the average week our observed value is, the more likely it is that the customers from that week were unusual---again depending on the size and spread of our sales.\nAnd this is what our margin of error is trying to help us understand.\n\nWhew!\nThat's quite a lot to chew on.\nBut, Boss wants more.\n\nLet's take a break and freshen up before things become *(even more)* theoretical.\n\n## Part 2 --- But does it matter?\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn this second part we will take a look at how another way to tell if the observed difference is meaningful.\nWe shall do this to begin to understand where our previous understanding comes from and compare it to the confidence intervals we are already familiar with.\n\n### Boss is back\n\nThe Boss is fair impressed with their new understanding of these concepts, but wants some extra assurance that this is not just some fluke week.\nTo this effect, Boss has heard tell of a **magic number** that \"*just tells you*\" if the new customers are different from the old.\n\n::: columns\n::: column\n![](../images/vb_p-998.png){width=\"210\" fig-align=\"center\" alt=\"Value box showing a p-value of 0.998.

The title bar is green indicating the results is different from the expected result to a meaningful degree.\"}\n:::\n\n::: column\nUnder the plots is a row of four boxes containing a value.\nThis magical number is displayed in the left-most box.\nThis number is closely related to the confidence interval, and is similarly burdened with some heinously (but necessarily) obtuse language.\nThis is a metric that asks:\n\n> if the customer base **had not** changed, how unusual would the data obtained be?\n:::\n:::\n\nThe more weird the data is---compared to our usual data---the more different the new average will be from the old average, and the **smaller** this magic number is.\nIt works on pass/fail basis based on a hard threshold.\nWithout delving any more deeply into the stats, we can say that this threshold is determined in the same way as the CI.\nEach margin of error is associated with a probability, which\n\n-   If we choose an MoE of 90%, that corresponds to a probability of 0.9, which gives a threshold of 0.1\n-   A MoE of 95% corresponds to a probability of 0.95, and give a threshold of 0.05\n-   A MoE of 99% corresponds to a probability of 0.99, and give a threshold of 0.01\n-   In other words subtract the probability from 1 to find the threshold (usually called alpha or $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$).\n\n::: {#box-diff-pop .callout-tip icon=\"'false\"}\n### **12. Discuss** {#compare-pops}\n\nIf we have successfully shifted our customer base we might see a new distribution of weekly sales (e.g. @fig-dist-comparison).\nWhether or not our magic number told us this was a meaningful change would depend on our sample size and spread, as we have already seen.\n\nDiscuss how this relates to our previous discussion on the [best CI level](#box-best-ci-disc)\n\n![Comparison of old (black) and new (red) weekly sales distributions indicating that our new customers do indeed come from a different base.](../images/d2-s1_plot_part-2_bell-comparison.png){#fig-dist-comparison width=\"40%\" fig-align=\"left\" alt=\"Two bell shaped curves, one centred over 100, another, narrower, one centred over 140.\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n### **13.

What does it represent?\nThe $x$ axis has been converted to a standardized scale.\nA bit like when e.g. country statistics are standardized to be understood in a per capita context.\nIn this case the $x$ axis represents the distance of the new, observed, value from the old, expected, value.\nThus $x = 0$ represents no difference between them.\n\n<!-- ::: {#fig-p-equals-1 layout=\"[[3,[[1],[1],[1]]]]\"} -->\n\n<!-- ![](../images/plot--p-1.png) -->\n\n<!-- ![](../images/vb--p-998.png) -->\n\n<!-- ![](../images/vb--cdf_5.png) -->\n\n<!-- ![](../images/vb--pdf_397.png) -->\n\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- ::: columns -->\n\n<!-- ::: column -->\n\n<!-- ![](../images/plot--p-1.png) -->\n\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- ::: column -->\n\n<!-- ![](../images/vb--p-998.png) -->\n\n<!-- ![](../images/vb--cdf_5.png) -->\n\n<!-- ![](../images/vb--pdf_397.png) -->\n\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- ::: -->\n\nNotice that when $x = 0$, $y = 0.5$.\nThis tells us that of all the values it is possible for the observation, 0.5, or 50% of them are less than the expected value.\nSo what about wherever your point is?\nFollow the point down to the $x$ axis, and this is how far your observed value deviates from the expected value, in these, aforementioned, standardized units.\nThe corresponding value on the $y$ axis is the probability of obtaining the current value, or any value even further to the left---a value that is **more extreme** in how far it deviates from the expected value.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n#### **15. Discuss**\n\nHit the ![](../images/btn_new-sample.png){width=\"108\" alt=\"\\\"New sample\\\"\"} button a few times, use what we have already learned today to try and get a p-value below the threshold.\n\nIf your observed value happens to be below the expected value, things might start to make sense.\n\nA low p-value will put the point low on the curve and far enough left as to be out side the yellow vertical line.\n\nHowever, spare a thought for those whose observed value is significantly above the expected value.\n\nIn those cases, the p-value will be very low, but the point will be high on the curve and far to the right.\n\n-   How should this apparent contradiction be interpreted?\n-   Think about the pattern(s) observed in your previous table. How does that fit with this \"contradiction\"?\n-   If the graph should be interpreted as the probability of values further to the left than the point, can you see a way to figure out the probability of an observed value $x$ where $-1 < x \\leq 0$\n:::\n\n### The PDF {#the-pdf}\n\nThe second curve on the right is slightly more difficult to grapple with just because the values on the $y$ axis are less intuitive; they are no longer probabilities.\nAt least the $x$ axis hasn't changed.\nIt is still in those same standardized units of how far the observation deviates from the expected average (you might call it a scale of **standard deviations**).\n\nHowever, as for the $y$ axis units, those are **densities** (?!?) but thankfully we do not need to go any deeper into that for our purposes.\nThe plot itself has to be understood in the context of the **area** under the entire curve.\nIt can still be interpreted in a similar way to the CDF.\nHowever, instead of adding up all the values further to the left we consider the area under two points.\nIf those two points are so close together, that we can't really distinguish them, then that is close enough for us to consider the area under a single observed point.\n\nIt turns out that if our two points happen to be at $\\pm1$ standard deviation, then the area of the curve within that range is about 68% of the total area under the entire curve.\nEven more interesting is that 95% of the total area under the curve is between $\\pm2$ standard deviations.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n#### **16. Discussion**\n\nWhile the CI makes perfectly reasonable sense in the cumulative function, above, the density function allows to come to a slightly different understanding.\n\nA common benchmark for declaring a difference between two groups (such as our old, and our new customer bases) is that their respective averages will be at least 2 standard deviations away from each other.\n\nPlay around with the different options for our margin of error.\n- How do the different MoE's compare to that convention.\n- Note that it is only a convention, and that we are free to use whatever threshold we like to declare that we are indeed tapping into a different customer base.\n- Think again about the previously mentioned \"contradiction\".\nIf the area under ±2 standard deviations account for 95% of the total area, how much must be beyond two standard deviations on **each side**?\n:::\n\nOne final point to bring us back around, full circle.\nPay close attention to the shape of the PDF curve, and change the sample size between, say 5, 10, 20 and 50.\nWe should notice two things.\nFirstly, the shape of the curve changes, and secondly the position of the yellow CI lines move.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n#### **17. Questions**\n\n-   What are the implications of these changes?\n-   What do they imply about the relationship between the sample size, our CI, and our ability to declare a true difference between our two customer bases?\n:::\n\n## The Boss want some answers\n\nBoss rocks up one final time.\nThey want some **definitive** answers to the following questions:\n\n1.  Did the marketing campaign succeeded in bringing in a different customer base?\n2.  If so, would we class it as a success?\n3.  What is your best estimate for the new average sale for the new customer base?\n    -   You might want to consider some nuance here.\n    -   Do you really want to put your neck on the line by giving a single estimated value?\n4.  The Boss wants to try a new marketing campaign.\n    -   Hit the ![](../images/btn_new-campaign){width=\"122\" height=\"40\" alt=\"New campaign\"} button at the top of the menu bar to target a different customer base, and start again!\n\n## Conclusion / summary\n\n### Summary of main learning points\n\nWe have covered *a lot* of concepts here.\nLet's get together and summarize them all with the instructors.\n\n-   Explored effects of [sample size](#sample-size)\n-   Explored effects of [variance](#precicion)\n-   Developed an understanding of [confidence intervals](#Margin-of-error)\n-   Developed an awareness that different levels of confidence bring certain trade-offs.\n    -   i.e. how much are you willing to accept incorrect estimates.\n-   Explored how to tell if a sample belongs to the same population or a different one ([difference in populations](#box-diff-pop)).\n-   begun to develop an awareness of distribution functions\n-   begun to understand how the distribution function relates to a business question ([CDF](#the-cdf) and [PDF](#the-pdf))\n-   and how they can be used to inform business decisions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy experimenting with the way sample size and variance interact we have seen how engaging with uncertainty helps us learn more about the processes of importance to us and our work.\n\nOver time, we can develop a deeper appreciation of these concepts.\nEventually, we will learn to incorporate our new understanding and apply it to our decision making processes, and become better at our own jobs.\n\nAs we learn to become more comfortable embracing uncertainty, we can create different strategies for those times when variance bites hard.\n\nIf we learn to embrace it better than our competitors, we can create options more quickly than they can, and just be better than them!\n",
