  This is often just inherent random noise.\n    -   Other times there may be a pattern associated\n    -   Ask participants if they can think of examples of both types.\n-   Sometimes the uncertainty originates with the person trying to work with the data.\n    -   E.g. a lack of knowledge or experience.\n    -   Should be easy to deal with by working with a diverse team.\n        -   Just asking for help might be enough.\n    -   Could it be an opportunity?\n        -   Personal development / staff training?\n    -   **This will lead into the next question about biases**\n-   These are examples of uncertainty we can identify.\n    -   But there may also be uncertainty about what we know\n    -   I.e. not knowing what we don't know\n        -   How can we prepare for things we don't even suspect?\n:::\n\n### Q2: Biases\n\nAims:\n\n:   Recognize that sometimes it is difficult to update our pre-existing world view.\n    We all have preconceived notions, i.e., this is normal, but it can become a problem if they blind us to patterns in out data.\n    Discuss how different types of bias affect our judgements.\n    How can we go about mitigating our biases.\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Consider steering group is different directions\n\nThe are examples of two different areas where bias can arise.\nIt might be interesting to have different groups explore both of these (or others).\n\nIt may be necessary to drop a hint about the importance of context framing when trying to confront biases.\n\nMany of these overlap\n\n-   **Cognitive biases**\n    -   Confirmation bias.\n        -   When you believe something to be true, then see it happen, your beliefs are confirmed; but maybe it was just coincidence.\n    -   Pet theories\n        -   Perhaps you're so convinced a certain decision or course of action is for the best, you can't / won't consider alternatives.\n-   **Data biases**\n    -   Selection bias\n        -   If ads target a particular demographic, it might be easy to assume that everyone is similar to the respondents, when really they could be a very distinct subset.\n    -   Survivor effects\n        -   How do customers that don't churn (survivors) affect perceptions\n    -   Attrition bias (kind of)\n        -   Who are the customers that churn?\n        -   Is there a systematic pattern that makes certain types of people more likely to churn?\n:::\n\n### Q3: Managing our uncertainty\n\nAims:\n\n:   Identify the steps that can help reduce anxiety caused by uncertainty, and that might suggest strategies of minimizing disruption.\n    Discuss how we might begin to quantify either the uncertainty itself, or its consequences on decision making (this will help set up tomorrows lab session).\n\nAppropriate management of uncertainty will depend on both where the uncertainty originates, and how we perceive and interact with the causes (i.e. the two previous topics).\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Try and work towards a framework\n\n*Note:* this flowchart below is not evidence based - I made it up.\nIt is just a idea that seems reasonable as a starting point for discussion or maybe building a more targeted strategy.\n\n![](../images/d1-s2_manage-uncertainty-flowchart.png)\n\n1.  Identify the problem or situation of interest.\\\n2.  Formulate a clear, unambiguous question / problem statement.\\\n3.  Collate and distil evidence on the sources of uncertainty.\\\n4.  Quantify the range of outcomes: weight on the outcomes according to how likely they are based on the evidence.\\\n5.  Formulate one or more courses of action.\n\nHow might you quantify the uncertainty?\ni.e. how large an effect is the uncertainty likely to have on expectations?\n:::\n\n## Q4: How can we become comfortable with uncertainty?\n\n**Aim:** To try and set expectation that, since uncertainty exists, and we cannot completely remove it, we need to learn to *embrace* it.\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Since we can't beat it, let's plan for it\n\n-   What if everyone else (i.e. competitors) manages uncertainty better that you?\n-   Is there any danger of overcompensating?\n    -   i.e. trying to plan for too many possibilities?\n-   **This would be a good time to hint at some kind of modelling approach**\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Good thing; bad thing\n\n-   What advantages might come from planning for different circumstances?\n-   What disadvantages might associated with planning for uncertainty?\n:::\n",
