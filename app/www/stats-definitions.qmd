When a change in what we do is followed by some change, it is tempting to believe that the change happened as a response to the change we implemented. For example, if after updating our website we receive a higher than usual number of bookings, we might ascribe the bookings to the new website.

The number of bookings will usually be fairly typical, but not exactly the same day-to-day.
The exact number will swing highrer and lower around some average number
It is even possible for these wobbles to be quite extreme, just by sheer randomness.

Imagine a survey that finds
