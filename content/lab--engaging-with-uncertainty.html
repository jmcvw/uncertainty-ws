<p>Consider a situation where a business has an average weekly sales value of exactly £100. This figure is the average over the entire history of the business, and is known to be exactly correct.</p>
<p>The Boss of this business wants to increase the average sale, so decides to implement a new marketing campaign designed to more effectively target a different subset of its customers - hopefully ones that spend more money.</p>
<p>In the first week following the new marketing campaign they find their average sale rose to £109.66. Higher indeed than the expected average of £100.</p>
<!-- ![Profit for the week following website changes](improved-sales.png){#fig-improved-profit fig-align='left' width=30% alt='The profit observed in the week following improvements to the website was £109.66'} -->
<p>Boss congratulates the team, and declares their new marketing strategy a success.</p>

For the purposes of this exercise, we shall consider this an unambiguous “truth” of what our business has made in an average week. It is therefore not a statistic, since statistics are values that are used to <strong>estimate</strong> “true” parameters.</p>

For our purposes, we will assume a change of at least <strong>1 percentage point</strong> to be an outcome that has real importance for our business.

Press it several times, and, after each press, record the new observed value. You should see that the observed value changes - possibly by quite a lot! Notice also that the two graphs on the right respond to any changes—more about these later.</p>
<p>There are several controls in the left sidebar that we can experiment with to help understand some of the factors that influence the value, and possibly indicate how much faith we should have in our results. There are quite a few controls, so lets explore them one at a time.</p>

<p>The Boss was somewhat impressed by your investigative skills, and is almost content to take your word for it. However, they realize that the average sale will vary week to week. They want you to give a best guess that somehow accounts for this variation.</p>
<p>Hopefully we were able to see, and articulate in our teams, how more sales affected our average sales value. However, just having more sales might not be enough to allow us to come to a decision. If you carried out the last instruction in the box above, you show have number of sales set to 100. The input below that is called “Spread of values”. Change this input to 50, hit <img src="images/btn--new-sample.png" class="img-fluid" alt="new sample" width="107"> a few more times. Hmm, things just got unpredictable again, right?</p>

<p>Ok, time for a slight confession—I’m afraid the task above was a little bit of a mean trick! To be fair, though, there was a clue in the section header. See, given a large enough number of sales, all three businesses could create similarly <strong>accurate</strong> projections. This what the mean does. while the estimate may jump about wildly when the sample size (number of sales) is small, it does so around the actual true mean. Where the businesses would differ is in the <strong>precision</strong> of their projections. In order to increase our precision we have to reduce the range within which the estimate jumps around.</p>
<p>The current input settings should be as show on the right, top. To get a better understanding of how the “spread” relates to the precision, check the “Show margin of error” box (right, bottom). This will make a few changes. First you will notice there are now error bars extending form the red point on the plot. One other thing that has changed is the box under the plot labelled “Confidence interval” now show the range of the margin of error (MoE).</p>

<p>You inform Boss that the margin of error you quoted is actually a 95% confidence interval. “Very good,” says Boss, “Why only 95%? Why not 99%? Actually, do we even need to be 95% confident? Can’t we settle for 90%?”</p>
<p>Well, these are all good questions.</p>
<p>Before you change the CI, discuss what will happen to the error bars when you change to 90% or 99%. Make a note of your expectations.</p>
<p>What might the pros and cons be for each option? Make a note of any ideas you have for these also.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So far we have been dealing with a 95%. Go ahead ahead now and change the selection.</p>
<p><img src="images/input--rb-ci-95.png" class="img-fluid" width="250"></p>
<p>Watch what happens to the error bars as you do this. Compare the changes to the notes you took in your previous discussion. Was your expectation correct? If not try and explain why.</p>
<p>Now here comes the hard stuff. It is a very common misunderstanding that a 95% confidence interval means that there is a 95% chance that the true value is within the CI. So lets break it down.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What do we mean by “true value”?
<ul>
<li>In our case, the true value is the <strong>actual</strong> average sale for our customer base</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We don’t know what that is, that is why we are guessing.
<ul>
<li>But every week, our CI is slightly different, so that proves the misunderstanding is false.</li>
<li>For several different CIs to all have a 95% chance of containing the true value doesn’t make sense</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If we turn that idea upside down and instead say…
<ul>
<li>Of the CIs we compute for the next <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> weeks, 95% of them will cover the true mean.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Hmmm, what does that actually mean? Well for one thing, it means even if we have everything in place exactly as we would like, we might still be wrong.</p>
<p>The more important question is how can we use this concept? Remember our question is to investigate whether our marketing campaign has caused a shift in out customer base. If we can show, within some level of confidence, that our new customer base spends a different amount on average than our old customer base, then we can conclude that our marketing campaign did cause a shift.</p>
<p>So, based on our new sample we have an estimate of our customer’s spends. And we have some margin of error around that mean. Now, here’s the clever bit.</p>
<ul>
<li>If that CI covers the expected average of the <em>old</em> customer base,
<ul>
<li>That means that the old average could be the true mean for the new base.</li>
<li>And, if that is true, we are forced to admit that there is no evidence that the customer base has been influenced by any meaningful amount.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conversely, if the CI <strong>does not</strong> cover the old average…
<ul>
<li><p>It suggests that the new average is sufficiently far from the old average</p></li>
<li><p>And that the spread of the data is accounted for well enough that we have evidence that the new customers are indeed from a different group than the old customers.</p></li>

<p>The Boss is fair impressed with their new understanding of these concepts, but wants some extra assurance that this is not just some fluke week. To this effect, Boss has heard tell of a magic number that “just tells you” if the new customers are different from the old.</p>

<p>This magical number is displayed under the plot, to the left of the CI box. This number is closely related to the confidence interval, and is similarly burdened with some heinously (but necessarily) obtuse language. This is a metric that asks if the customer base <strong>had not</strong> changed, how unusual would the data obtained from the new customer base be?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The more weird the data is, the more different the new average will be from the old average, and the smaller this magic number is. It work on pass/fail basis based on a hard threshold. Without delving any more deeply into the stats, we can say that this threshold is determined in the same way as the CI. Each margin of error is associated with a probability, which</p>
<ul>
<li>If we choose an MoE of 90%, that correspond to a probability of 0.9, which gives a threshold of 0.1
<ul>
<li><p>MoE of 95% corresponds to a probability of 0.95, and give a threshold of 0.05</p></li>
<li><p>MoE of 99% corresponds to a probability of 0.99, and give a threshold of 0.01</p></li>

<strong>12. Task</strong>
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Using what we have learned so far, see if you can create a situation where we this “P value” tells us that our new customers are in fact different from out old ones. Depending on the random component of your app, this may be difficult. You will know when you have managed because the bar under the box where “P value” is written will change colour.</p>
<p>If you manage this, look at the CI box to the right, look at the error bars on the plot above, and take note of the location of the red points on the two graphs on the right (the CDF and PDF).</p>
<p><img src="images/plot--distrs-sig-neg.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:30.0%"></p>

<p>The p-value is a useful metric, but the importance of it is easily and often overstated. We are going to try and understand it in the context of these other two graphs: the <strong>cumulative distribution function</strong> (CDF) and the <strong>probability density function</strong> (PDF).</p>

<p>Unlike many things in statistics (p value? confidence interval?) the CDF is perhaps less complicated than might be expected. To explore it we shall make another table from our data.</p>

<p>Hopefully, there is some hint of a relationship between the p-value and the CDF curve. But what does it mean? The <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis ranges from 0 to 1. These values are <strong>probabilities</strong> (it is impossible to have a probability outwith those bonds). The value on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis corresponding to the point is straight forward. But what about the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis? (If you cant find it, it is shared with the PDF, and is printed at the bottom of the bottom graph.) What does it represent? The <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis has been converted to a standardized scale. A bit like when e.g.&nbsp;country statistics are standardized to be understood in a per capita context. In this case the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis represents the distance of the new, observed, value from the old, expected, value. Thus <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> represents no difference between them.</p>

<p>Notice that when <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y = 0.5\)</span>. This tells us that of all the values it is possible for the observation, 0.5, or 50% of them are less than the expected value. So what about wherever your point is? Follow the point down to the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis, and this is how far your observed value deviates from the expected value, in these, aforementioned, standardized units. The corresponding value on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis is the probability of obtaining the current value, or any value even further to the left—a value that is <strong>more extreme</strong> in how far it deviates from the expected value.</p>

<p>The second curve on the right is slightly more difficult to grapple with just because the values on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis are less intuitive; they are no longer probabilities. At least the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis hasn’t changed. It is still in those same standardized units of how far the observation deviates from the expected average (you might call it a scale of <strong>standard deviations</strong>).</p>
<p>However, as for the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis units, those are <strong>densities</strong> (?!?) but thankfully we do not need to go any deeper into that for our purposes. The plot itself has to be understood in the context of the <strong>area</strong> under the entire curve. It can still be interpreted in a similar way to the CDF. However, instead of adding up all the values further to the left we consider the area under two points. If those two points are so close together, that we can’t really distinguish them, then that is close enough for us to consider the area under a single observed point.</p>
<p>It turns out that if our two points happen to be at <span class="math inline">\(\pm1\)</span> standard deviation, then the area of the curve within that range is about 68% of the total area under the entire curve. Even more interesting is that 95% of the total area under the curve is between <span class="math inline">\(\pm2\)</span> standard deviations.</p>

<strong>15. Discussion</strong>
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>While the CI makes perfectly reasonable sense in the cumulative function, above, the density function allows to come to a slightly different understanding.</p>
<p>A common benchmark for declaring a difference between two groups (such as our old, and our new customer bases) is that their respective averages will be at least 2 standard deviations away from each other.</p>
<p>Play around with the different options for our margin of error. - How do the different MoE’s compare to that convention. - Note that it is only a convention, and that we are free to use whatever threshold we like to declare that we are indeed tapping into a different customer base. - Think again about the previously mentioned “contradiction”. If the area under ±2 standard deviations account for 95% of the total area, how much must be beyond two standard deviations on <strong>each side</strong>?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>One final point to bring us back around, full circle. Pay close attention to the shape of the PDF curve, and change the sample size between, say 5, 10, 20 and 50. We should notice two things. Firstly, the shape of the curve changes, and secondly the position of the yellow CI lines move.</p>
