## Scenario

Consider a situation where a business has an average weekly profit of exactly Â£100.
Each week there is a new average profit that can be compared to the overall, historic, weekly average profit.
The business wants to increase its average weekly profit, so decides to change its website to more effectively target a different subset of its customers.
In the first week following changes to the website they find there profit is indeed higher than the expected average...


## Average expectation

![Sample average (observed) vs expected average](01--data-literacy-lab--sample-size.png){#fig-exp-vs-sample width=30% alt='Plot showing a horizontal line labelled "Expected" at y = 100 and a point slightly above the expected line indicating the average observed from a sample.' fig-align='left'}

Looking at @fig-exp-vs-sample we see that the recent sample yielded an average profit higher than the historic average.

:::{.callout-tip icon=false}
### __Questions__

1. How much would you trust that this increased profit is likely to continue in future weeks?
1. What factors can you identify that might support your answer for question 1?
    i. If you would be enthusiastic that this is a strong result to take to the line manager, create a list of reasons that justify your belief.
    i. If you are less than enthusiastic create a list of reasons, along with ideas that would increase your willingness to go to the boss.
    i. If you are not sure, create both of the above lists!

:::

Now that you have created a list follow this [link][app-link].
The plot on the left is the same as that in @fig-exp-vs-sample, but with a different "observed" value.
We can simulate what the observed value might be like in future weeks by pressing the ![new sample](new-sample-button.png){width=20%} button.
Press it several times, and after each press notice that the observed value changes - possibly by quite a lot!
There are several controls in the left sidebar that we can experiment with to help understand which situations might lead to more reliable results.
There are a lot of controls, so lets explore them one at a time.

## Sample size

The first control on the left is labeled "sample size", and is currently set at 2.
This means that our observed average is based on only two customers.
If our data are based on inly 2 customers how likely is it that they reprsent our "average customer"?

## OUTLINE

### Sampling

- Hit `New sample` repeatedly
- Notice that each time the `observed` value changes
    - sometimes higher than expected, sometimes lower
- Increase the `Average value` input to 120
    - Hit `New sample` a few more times
    - Notice now that the value still changes every time, but is below the expected value less often
    
- Return `Average value` to 100
- Increase `Sample size` to 100
    - Hit `New sample` a few more times
    - Notice notice that while the observed value still fluctuates both above and below the expected line, it is far closer to the expected line

- Ensure `Average value` is set to 100
- Return `Sample size` to 5
- Check the `Show points` box
- Repeat the above
